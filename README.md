## How can You help?

Data Insights! Such large amount of data could do with some good insights.

### Idea 1

A data overview in the README sha. Such insights can be generated by a script.

E.g.
170,000 polling units

State | LGAs | Wards | Polling Units
Abia | 13 | 130 | 1568
Lagos | 24 | 235 | 5000

### Idea 2

There are polling units with missing locations. We need a way to rapidly find and correct them. A table might be helpful. Such insights can be generated by a script.
